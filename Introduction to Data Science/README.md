# Introduction to Data Science

This was a unit that I've done in my 1st year. This unit's objective was to get a general understanding of how Data Science works and the general process behind it. The projects done in this unit are summarised below. Feel free to go through the PDF as well, inside them are my work and steps that I've done to process and extract information. The format may look off due to the werid extraction process from Jupyter Notebook. I don't know of a better way to extract Jupyter notebook files, so my apologies for that.

Things I've learnt:
	- Using Pandas in Python to do Data Cleansing/Extraction
	- Data Visualisation using Pandas (Through most types of charts and graphs)
	- Using Cygwin to manipulate relatively large data through pipeline operations
	- A brief introduction to Machine Learning to process data (eg. k-clustering) -> Shown at the end of Mail Traffic

## Covid-19 Infection Rates and Analysis (Pandas)
This project was based on the current situation of that time, where Covid-19 started to flourish and grow. Thus, using Open data from different countries to inspect the infection rates in several countries and if a lockdown was effective in culling the spread of it. Furthermore, research was done to try and backup trends.

A project to get used to the steps taken in creating a new Data-frame from relatively raw data. Thus, data cleansing has to be done to remove inconsistencies, replace anomalies and fill in missing data. After this process, Data visualisation can be done on the now crafted data frames. Analysis is then done on the visualisations.

## Mail Traffic Analysis (Pandas, Regression and a bit of Machine Learning)
This project was based on mail traffic in Australia's Capital Ports. An overall analysis, using multiple techniques e.g. regression and visualisation, in the growth of mail traffic across the years.

Employs more in-depth usages of pandas to transform data into meaningful information. Introduces the usages of machine learning and how they might help in data processing and analysis.

## Facebook Dataset (Cygwin and R-studio)
This project was based on extracting data from a relatively large source. Normal usages of pandas cannot be done effectively, hence, the introduction of Cygwin and its pipeline capabilities to process and manipulate large-scale data. Afterwards, converting of the processed data into meaningful visualisations using R-studio. Contains very detailed steps of what was done and explanation of code.

Introduction to processing larger amounts of data using Cygwin. Then introduction of R-studio plotting.
