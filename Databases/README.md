# Databases
This unit is based on learning the best practices to creating and designing a Database from scratch. Involves the usages of Oracle SQL to build a fully functional Database.
 
Things I have Learnt:
 1. The understanding of Database Paradigm
 1. Created a Conceptual model of a Database from a simulated client
 1. Normalisation Process
 1. Created a Logical Model from merging results of Normalisation and Conceptual
 1. Creation of Database and Insertion of Data
 1. Advanced Query Search of Databases

Below are the table of contents and projects that I've done in this unit. It will cover all the things mentioned in the list above and more. It'll show the process in which I've gone through to create a database from scratch and through clients requirements.

## Table of Contents:

## Animal Doctors Conceptual Model
[File Preview](https://github.com/RyTang/Monash-Projects/blob/main/Databases/ad_conceptual.pdf)

This is a version of the conceptual model that I have created based on the situation given from Animal Doctors.

## Animal Doctors Normalisation Process
[File Preview](https://github.com/RyTang/Monash-Projects/blob/main/Databases/ad_normalisation.pdf)

Conducting the normalisation process based on administration forms used by Animal Doctors to make records.

## Animal Doctors Logical Model
[File Preview](https://github.com/RyTang/Monash-Projects/blob/main/Databases/ad_logical.pdf)

The merging of the information gathered from both conceptual model and normalisation to create a logical model. The logical model was then created using Oracle.
