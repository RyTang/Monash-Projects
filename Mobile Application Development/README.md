# Mobile Application (Android)
This unit steps us through the development process of making a fully fledge android application using Android Studio. Here are some of the things I've learnt to do:

1. Link an operational firebase database to the application and allow real time changes to occur across the board.
1. Read incoming messages and extracting information from it to fill in details
1. Functionalities such as gesture detection and drawer layouts.

Project will soon be uploaded and displayed (Cleansing needs to be done)
