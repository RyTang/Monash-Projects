# Algorithm and Data Structures

These are all the projects that I have experienced and gone through in this unit in Monash Malaysia. This unit is based on understanding more efficient data structures with effective algorithms and applying them to solve new problems. Examples of learnt algorithms are like Dijkstra, Dynamic programming, Bellman Ford, Directed Acyclic Graphs with Topological Sorts, Flow networks with Ford-Fulkerson. This unit resulted in me learning how to analyse general problem solving strategies and algorithmic paradigms, and applying them to solve new problems.

Below is a brief description of each type of problems solved in the unit, with their given synopsis and title. If you choose to view the python files, they each contain an in-depth brief of the problem and my personal methodology to solve the problem with algorithms I've learned so far. So feel free to browse through them if you want. However please don't copy them without my permission.

## Dynamic Programming
These problems required the usage of dynamic programming to solve. 

### Athlete Work's Schedule:
An Athlete is having trouble finding the highest amount of cash they can earn in a certain number of weeks. The problem they face requires them to decide to either work as a personal trainer or participate in competitions (cash prize included) in certain weeks. However, they can't do both in the same week.
 
### Sales Itinerary:
A Salesperson is stuck in a COVID-19 Situation. Pre-pandemic, they used to commute to different cities to work to get the highest possible income available. However, during the crisis each city has imposed their own quarantine period to any traveller that desire to work in the city. Help the salesperson to find the highest possible income available now.

## Trie Data Structures

### DNA Fragments:
The purpose is to design an efficient data system that keeps track of Bacteria DNA strands inputted by researchers. The data system needs to be queried to return the most similar strand available.

### OrfFinder:
A similar situation as DNA Fragment. Researchers needs an efficient way to find multiple combinations within a genome that begins with a certain pattern and ends with another pattern.


## Graph Algorithms

Involves the own implementation of a full Min-Heap, Graph (Inclusive of Dijkstra & Bellman-Ford algorithm). 

### Liquid Trading:
A Liquid Trader arrives in a village, and they are having trouble finding the highest value they can earn from liquid trading. Each villager have trades they are willing to offer, however
trading takes times and the trader is on a very tight schedule. Devise a efficient function to find the highest amount of value they can procure in the time period.

### Optional Delivery:
A traveller wants to travel to a certain city in the cheapest way possible. They've heard that they can opt to do a delivery to cut some travelling cost. However, the delivery might take them out of the cheapest path possible. Thus, help the traveller find the cheapest way to their destination and decide if doing the delivery is worth the risk.
