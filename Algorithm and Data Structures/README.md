# Algorithm and Data Structures

These are all the projects that I have experienced and gone through in this unit in Monash Malaysia. This unit is based on understanding more efficient data structures with effective algorithms and applying them to solve new problems. Examples of learnt algorithms are like Dijkstra, Dynamic programming, Bellman Ford, Directed Acyclic Graphs with Topological Sorts, Flow networks with Ford-Fulkerson. This unit resulted in me learning how to analyse general problem solving strategies and algorithmic paradigms, and applying them to solve new problems.
